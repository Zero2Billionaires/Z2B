## ü§ñ AI COACHING SYSTEM

### **How Coach ManLaw AI Works:**

#### **1. Context-Aware Coaching**

The AI knows:
- Your current day/lesson
- Your BTSS scores
- Your completed lessons
- Your struggle areas (based on chat history)

**Example conversation**:
```
User: "I'm struggling with the mindset shift"

Coach ManLaw: "I see you're on Day 12 and your Mindset Mystery
score is 45%. That's growth from your Day 1 baseline of 30%!
The resistance you're feeling is normal. Today's lesson on
'The Power of Visualization' will help. Also, have you
completed Day 11's 10x goal exercise? That's the foundation
for today's visualization."
```

---

#### **2. Curriculum Integration**

AI references your specific lesson:
```javascript
const currentLesson = getLessonByDay(currentDay);

AIPrompt = `
CURRENT CURRICULUM CONTEXT:
- Current Lesson: "${currentLesson.title}"
- Week ${currentLesson.week}: ${currentLesson.theme}
- Phase: ${currentLesson.phaseTitle}
- Focus Area: ${currentLesson.btssImpact}
- Today's Content: ${currentLesson.content}
- Today's Activity: ${currentLesson.activity}
- Today's Assignment: ${currentLesson.assignment}

Reference their current lesson naturally in conversation.
Guide them through today's specific challenges.
`;
```

---

#### **3. Personalized Guidance**

Based on your BTSS scores, AI recommends:
- Which leg needs most attention
- Specific lessons to review
- Z2B apps to use
- Daily focus areas

**Example**:
```
Coach ManLaw: "Your Money Moves leg is at 35%, while your
Mindset is at 68%. Let's focus on building income systems
this week. I recommend using ZYRA (AI Sales Agent) to
automate lead qualification while you work on Phase 2
lessons. Have you set up your sales funnel from Day 30?"
```

---

#### **4. AI Fuel System**

Each conversation uses AI Fuel:
- **Question to AI**: -1 AI Fuel
- **AI Response**: Generated
- **Fuel depleted**: Upgrade prompt shown

**Refills**:
- Bronze: 100/month
- Silver: 300/month
- Gold: 600/month
- Platinum: 1000/month
- Lifetime: Unlimited
