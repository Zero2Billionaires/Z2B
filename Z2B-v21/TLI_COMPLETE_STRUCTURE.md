## Hybrid Distribution Formula

### How It Works:

1. **Calculate Quarterly Pool**:
   ```
   Quarterly Pool = 10% of Total Member TeamPV (3 months combined)
   ```

2. **Distribute Minimum Guarantees**:
   - Each qualified builder receives their level's minimum guarantee first
   - Example: Level 10 builder gets R2,500,000 minimum

3. **Calculate Remaining Pool**:
   ```
   Remaining Pool = Quarterly Pool - All Minimum Guarantees Paid
   ```

4. **Distribute Pool Bonus by Points**:
   - Each level has a point value (1 to 512)
   - Total all points from all qualified builders
   - Divide remaining pool by total points to get "per point value"
   - Each builder receives: (Their Level Points × Per Point Value)

5. **Final Payment**:
   ```
   Builder's Total = Minimum Guarantee + Pool Bonus
   ```

---

## Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Quarterly pool of R10,000,000

**Qualified Builders**:
- 100 builders at Level 1 (100 × 1 = 100 points)
- 50 builders at Level 2 (50 × 2 = 100 points)
- 25 builders at Level 3 (25 × 4 = 100 points)
- 10 builders at Level 4 (10 × 8 = 80 points)
- 5 builders at Level 5 (5 × 16 = 80 points)
- 2 builders at Level 6 (2 × 32 = 64 points)
- 1 builder at Level 7 (1 × 64 = 64 points)
- 1 builder at Level 10 (1 × 512 = 512 points)

**Total Points**: 1,100 points

**Step 1 - Minimum Guarantees**:
- Level 1: 100 × R2,500 = R250,000
- Level 2: 50 × R5,000 = R250,000
- Level 3: 25 × R10,000 = R250,000
- Level 4: 10 × R25,000 = R250,000
- Level 5: 5 × R50,000 = R250,000
- Level 6: 2 × R100,000 = R200,000
- Level 7: 1 × R250,000 = R250,000
- Level 10: 1 × R2,500,000 = R2,500,000
- **Total Minimums**: R4,200,000

**Step 2 - Remaining Pool**:
```
R10,000,000 - R4,200,000 = R5,800,000 for pool bonus
```

**Step 3 - Per Point Value**:
```
R5,800,000 ÷ 1,100 points = R5,273 per point
```

**Step 4 - Level 10 Builder Receives**:
```
Minimum: R2,500,000
Pool Bonus: 512 points × R5,273 = R2,699,776
Total: R5,199,776 for the quarter
```

**Step 5 - Level 1 Builder Receives**:
```
Minimum: R2,500
Pool Bonus: 1 point × R5,273 = R5,273
Total: R7,773 for the quarter
```

## Path to Level 10: Real Numbers (UPDATED)

To reach **ETERNAL AS THE COSMOS** (Level 10), here's what you need:

### Direct Requirements:
- **Monthly TeamPV**: 200,000 PV
- **Active Members**: ~600-800 active builders (averaging 250-350 PV each)
- **Qualified Leaders**: **7 personally invited leaders at Level 8** (2 ranks lower)

### What This REALLY Means:

Each of your 7 Level 8 leaders needs:
- 100,000 monthly TeamPV
- 7 personally invited leaders at Level 6 ("MAMA I MADE IT")

So YOUR organization has:
- **7 front-line legs** (your personal invites)
- **49+ Level 6 leaders** (7 × 7 minimum)
- **Hundreds of Level 1-5 leaders**
- **Thousands of active members**

### Organization Depth & Width:
- **Width**: 7 strong legs in your front line
- **Depth**: Each leg is at least 6 levels deep (to reach Level 8)
- **Total Organization**: 2,000-5,000+ members
- **Monthly Team Volume**: R600,000 - R1,000,000+ in purchases

### Timeline Estimate:
- **Average builder**: 6-10 years of consistent building
- **Exceptional builder**: 3-5 years with aggressive growth and massive recruiting
- **World-class builder**: 2-3 years with viral expansion and celebrity influence

**The 7-Leader Rule**: This requirement ensures ONLY massive team builders reach the top. You can't "luck into" Level 10. You must BUILD BIG!
