## 🎓 For Users: How to Use Stage Tracking

### 1. Know Your Current Stage
Every day, you'll see:
- Current day number
- Current stage name
- Stage description
- What you should focus on

### 2. Celebrate Stage Completions
When you complete a stage milestone:
- Take your BTSS assessment
- Review your growth
- Celebrate your progress
- Prepare for next stage

### 3. Don't Skip Stages
The stages are sequential. You can't build systems (Stage 5) if you haven't made your first sale (Stage 4). Trust the process.

### 4. Track All 4 Legs
While each stage has a primary focus leg, keep tracking all 4:
- 🧠 Mindset Mystery
- 💸 Money Moves
- ⚙️ Legacy Missions
- 🌍 Momentum Movement

### 5. Use Stage Language
When talking with Coach or your community:
- "I'm on Stage 3, discovering my niche"
- "Just completed Stage 4, made my first sale!"
- "Struggling with Stage 2, need mindset help"
