## AI Fuel Management

### Understanding AI Fuel

**What is AI Fuel?**
AI Fuel is your credit system for using AI features across all apps. Every AI operation costs fuel.

**How Do You Get AI Fuel?**
1. **Monthly Allocation** (with your tier)
2. **Top-Up Purchases** (instant, any time)
3. **Commissions** (from team purchases)

### AI Fuel Top-Up System

#### Why Top-Up?

- Don't wait for month-end
- Seize opportunities immediately
- No interruption in your workflow
- Support your upline (they earn commission)

#### Top-Up Packages

| Package | Price | Bonus Fuel | Total Fuel | Best For |
|---------|-------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Starter** | R125 | 0 | 100 | Light users |
| **Popular** | R625 | +100 (20%) | 600 | Regular users |
| **Power** | R1,250 | +500 (50%) | 1,500 | Heavy users |

#### How to Top-Up

**Step 1: Access Top-Up Page**
- Dashboard sidebar: "⚡ AI Fuel Top-Up"
- Dashboard stat card: "Top-Up Now" button
- Quick Actions: "AI Fuel Top-Up"

**Step 2: Select Package**

### AI Fuel Validity

**Important:** Topped-up fuel is valid for 3 months from purchase date.

**Example:**
- Purchase date: January 24, 2025
- Expiry date: April 24, 2025
- Remaining fuel expires if not used

**Best Practice:**
- Top up based on your usage
- Don't buy more than you'll use in 3 months
- Track your burn rate

### Commission Structure

When you top-up, your upline earns:

| Your Tier | Commission Rate | Example (R625 purchase) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Bronze | 10% | R62.50 |
| Copper | 15% | R93.75 |
| Silver | 20% | R125.00 |
| Gold | 25% | R156.25 |
| Platinum | 30% | R187.50 |
| Diamond | 35% | R218.75 |

**This means:** The higher your tier, the more your upline earns when you purchase. It's a win-win!

### Tracking Your Usage

**View Fuel Balance:**
- Dashboard stat card shows current balance
- Updates in real-time
- Color-coded:
  - Green: 200+ fuel
  - Yellow: 50-199 fuel
  - Red: <50 fuel (time to top-up!)

**Fuel Usage History:**

- See which apps consume most fuel
- Optimize your usage

### Managing Multiple Fuel Packages

**How it Works:**
- You can purchase multiple times
- Each purchase has its own 3-month validity
- Oldest fuel used first (FIFO - First In, First Out)

**Example:**
```
Purchase 1: 100 fuel (expires March 1)
Purchase 2: 500 fuel (expires April 1)

When you use fuel:
- Uses from Purchase 1 first
