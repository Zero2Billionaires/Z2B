## 🎯 How ZYRA Works

### The Automation Flow

```
1. LEAD ARRIVES
   ↓
2. ZYRA GREETS THEM (within 60 seconds)
   ↓
3. QUALIFIES INTEREST (asks about pain points)
   ↓
4. PROVIDES VALUE (shares testimonials, videos)
   ↓
5. HANDLES OBJECTIONS (time, money, skepticism)
   ↓
6. CLOSES DEAL (sends signup link when ready)
   ↓
7. NOTIFIES YOU (hot leads get flagged)
```

### AI Personality

ZYRA is designed to sound like a **friendly, confident mentor** — NOT a pushy sales agent:

- ✅ Short, simple messages (2-3 sentences)
- ✅ Uses emojis naturally
- ✅ Empathetic and relatable
- ✅ Provides value BEFORE asking for anything
- ✅ Adapts to user's language style
- ✅ Never robotic or scripted

**Example Conversation:**

```
ZYRA: Hey Sarah! 👋 I saw you're interested in building extra income
      while working your nursing job. I totally get it - those 12-hour
      shifts are draining 😮‍💨 Quick question: What's your biggest reason
      for looking into this?

SARAH: I just need more money honestly. Bills are piling up.

ZYRA: I hear you! 💪 So here's the thing - a lot of nurses have used
      this exact system to make an extra R5,000-R15,000/month. All while
      working their regular job. Does that sound like something you'd be
      interested in?

SARAH: How much does it cost though?

ZYRA: Fair question! The starter tier is R480/month (that's like R16 a day 😅).
      And here's the thing: most people make that back in their first week.
      Want me to send you a quick 2-min video that shows exactly how it works?
```
