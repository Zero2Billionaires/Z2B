## WORST-CASE PAYOUT SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### Scenario 1: New Platinum Builder Invites Another Platinum (First 90 Days)

**Sale:** Platinum package at R4,980

**Payouts:**
1. **ISP to Sponsor (Platinum):** 45% = R2,241
2. **QPB to Sponsor's Upline:** 10% = R498
3. **TSC Generation 2 (Sponsor's Sponsor):** 10% = R498
4. **TSC Generations 3-10 (8 uplines):**
   - G3: 5% = R249
   - G4: 3% = R149.40
   - G5: 2% = R99.60
   - G6-G10: 1% each = R49.80 × 5 = R249
   - **TSC Total (G3-G10):** R747
5. **TLI Pool Contribution:** 10% of PV (249 points) = Quarterly allocation
6. **Total Immediate Payout:** R2,241 + R498 + R498 + R747 = **R3,984**

**Analysis:**
- Revenue: R4,980
- Immediate Payout: R3,984
- **Remaining:** R996 (20%)
- **TLI Pool Obligation:** ~R166 (3.33% monthly equivalent)
- **Net Before CEA/CEC:** R830 (16.7%)
- **After CEA/CEC (est. 5%):** R581 (11.7%)

**RESULT: Only 11.7% gross profit - UNSUSTAINABLE**

---

### Scenario 2: Established Team (After 90 Days, No QPB)

**Sale:** Platinum package at R4,980

**Payouts:**
1. **ISP to Sponsor (Platinum):** 45% = R2,241
2. **TSC All Generations:** 25% = R1,245
3. **TLI Pool:** ~3.33% monthly = R166
4. **CEA/CEC:** ~5% = R249
5. **Total Payout:** R2,241 + R1,245 + R166 + R249 = **R3,901**

**Analysis:**
- Revenue: R4,980
- Total Payout: R3,901
- **Remaining:** R1,079 (21.7%)

**RESULT: Only 21.7% gross profit - STILL BELOW 30% TARGET**

## CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 🔴 Problem 1: ISP + TSC Combination (70% Total)
- **ISP:** 45% (Platinum)
- **TSC:** 25% (10 generations)
- **Combined:** 70% of every sale
- **This alone makes 30% profit impossible!**

### 🔴 Problem 2: TLI Pool is 10% of ALL TeamPV
- Every sale contributes to quarterly pool
- Pool must be paid regardless of profitability
- Creates fixed obligation

### 🔴 Problem 3: Multiple Cascading Payouts
- One sale triggers 10+ separate commissions
- Each generation gets paid
- Exponential payout as team grows

### 🔴 Problem 4: 50% Beta Discount Reduces Revenue
- Prices are already discounted 50%
- Further reduces profit margin
- Beta pricing unsustainable long-term

## RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: HYBRID APPROACH

### New Pricing Structure (Remove Beta Discount Gradually)

**Year 1 (Beta):** 50% discount (current)
**Year 2:** 30% discount
**Year 3:** 15% discount
**Year 4+:** Full retail

### New Commission Structure (Effective Immediately)

#### ISP (Individual Sales Profit):
- **Bronze:** 18% (was 25%) - Still R86 on R480 sale
- **Copper:** 22% (was 30%) - Still R216 on R980 sale
- **Silver:** 25% (was 35%) - Still R370 on R1,480 sale
- **Gold:** 28% (was 40%) - Still R834 on R2,980 sale
- **Platinum:** 30% (was 45%) - Still R1,494 on R4,980 sale

**Justification:** Higher absolute earnings as team grows and prices increase

#### TSC (Team Sales Commission) - UNCHANGED:
- G2: 10%
- G3: 5%
- G4: 3%
- G5: 2%
- G6-G10: 1% each
- **Total:** 25%

**Justification:** This is your differentiator - deep team payouts build massive organizations

#### TLI (Team Leadership Incentive):
- **Reduce Pool to 8%** (was 10%)

**Justification:** Still very generous, creates sustainability

#### CEA/CEC (CEO Programs):
- **Cap at 3% combined** (was ~5%)

**Justification:** Quality over quantity for recognition programs

## FINAL PROFITABILITY CALCULATION (RECOMMENDED MODEL)

### Platinum Sale at Current Beta Price (R4,980):

**Revenue:** R4,980

**Payouts:**
- ISP (30%): R1,494
- TSC (25%): R1,245
- TLI (2.67% monthly equivalent of 8%): R133
- CEA/CEC (3%): R149
- **Total Payout:** R3,021

**Gross Profit:** R1,959 (39.3%) ✅

**Office Expenses & Operating Costs (est. 15%):** R747
**Net Profit Before Tax:** R1,212 (24.3%)
**Tax (28% SA corporate rate):** R339
**Net Profit After Tax:** R873 (17.5%)

---

## MARKUP PERCENTAGE CALCULATION

To achieve **30% gross profit**, here's the formula:

```
Required Markup = Total Commissions / (1 - Desired Gross Profit %)

With 30% gross profit target:
Total Commissions = 60.67% (ISP 30% + TSC 25% + TLI 2.67% + CEA/CEC 3%)
Remaining for Gross Profit = 30%
Remaining for COGS (AI costs, etc.) = 9.33%

Required Price = COGS × (1 / 0.0933) = COGS × 10.72x
```

### Cost Structure Analysis:

**Estimated Monthly COGS per Platinum Member:**
- OpenAI API costs (500 fuel/day @ R1.50 per 100 fuel): R225
- Infrastructure (hosting, bandwidth): R50
- Customer support: R25
- **Total COGS:** R300/month

**Required Retail Price for 30% Gross Profit:**
- Total Commission Payout (60.67%): R1,821
- Gross Profit Target (30%): R900
- COGS (9.33%): R280
- **Total Required:** R3,001/month

**Current Price:** R4,980 (one-time)
**Current Model:** Pay-as-you-go refuel

**Analysis:** Current pricing structure is SUSTAINABLE with recommended commission adjustments!
