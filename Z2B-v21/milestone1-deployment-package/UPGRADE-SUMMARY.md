## 📝 CONTENT UPDATES COMPLETED

### 2. Updated "Capped Income" Section

**OLD:**
```
You work harder than your boss, but your salary is locked.
No matter how much you give, the ceiling stays low.
Meanwhile, the owner gets richer from your effort.
```

**NEW:**
```
You work hard, stay loyal, and give your energy—but your earnings
are predetermined. As the cost of living keeps rising, the ceiling
remains fixed, regardless of effort, while the system continues to
grow from what you produce.
```

### 3. Added TWO New Pain Points

#### NEW PAIN POINT #1:
**Title:** No Time Freedom or Control Over Your Life
**Description:** Trading time for money means fixed schedules you don't control. Limited leave days that must be "approved." Missed family moments, constant burnout, living for weekends.

#### NEW PAIN POINT #2:
**Title:** No Ownership, No Legacy, No Wealth
**Description:** You work for years but don't own the company you help grow. Building someone else's asset, not your own. Retirement comes with limited savings and no scalable legacy.

**Total Pain Points:** Now 6 (was 4)

### 4. TEEE Framework Definition CORRECTED

**OLD:** Time. Energy. Experience. Expertise.
**NEW:** Transformation. Education. Empowerment. and Enrichment.

**Updated in:**

### 5. Milestone Count CORRECTED
