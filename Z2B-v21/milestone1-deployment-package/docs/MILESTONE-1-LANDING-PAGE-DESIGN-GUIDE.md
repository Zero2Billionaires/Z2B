**File Name:** `hero-bg-overlay.png`
**Description for Designer/AI:**

**Alternative:** Can use a solid gradient - already implemented in CSS.

---

### Pain Mirror Section - Main Image
**File Name:** `pain-mirror-image.jpg`
**Dimensions:** 1200px x 700px (16:9 ratio)
**Description for Canva/Unsplash/AI Generation:**

> **Scenario:** A professional African employee (30-40 years old, business casual attire) sitting at an office desk, looking contemplative and frustrated. The person is staring at a computer screen or looking away pensively, hand on chin or forehead. The environment shows a typical corporate office: cubicle walls, fluorescent lighting, stacks of papers, coffee cup. The mood is: exhaustion, quiet frustration, being trapped in routine.
>
> **Emotional Tone:** Not angry, but weary. The "I can't keep doing this" realization moment. The quiet desperation of Sunday evening before Monday morning.
>
> **Visual Style:** Realistic photography, natural lighting (slightly dim to convey mood), muted corporate colors (grays, beiges, whites). The person should look professional, intelligent, capable—not defeated, but clearly questioning their path.
>
> **Keywords for AI Image Generation:**
> "African professional employee at office desk, frustrated, contemplative, corporate environment, business casual, tired expression, realistic photography, natural lighting, modern office space, exhaustion, career dissatisfaction"

**Alternative Stock Photo Search Terms:**
- "African business person frustrated at work"
- "Black professional contemplating career change"
- "Corporate employee burnout Africa"
- "Professional at desk thinking deeply"

## 📝 COPY BREAKDOWN BY SECTION

### 1️⃣ HERO SECTION

**Headline:**
"Before You Change Your Life, Clarify Your Foundation"

**Subheadline:**
"You can't build ownership on confusion. Milestone 1 gives you the Vision Board and SWOT Analysis (using the TEEE Framework) to face the truth about where you are—and where you're actually going."

**CTA Button Text:**
"START MILESTONE 1 FREE"

**Copy Notes:**
- Headline addresses the need for clarity before action
- Subheadline introduces the deliverables immediately
- CTA is action-oriented and emphasizes FREE access
- No fluff, no promises of easy success—just clarity

---

### 2️⃣ PAIN MIRROR SECTION

**Section Headline:**
"You Already Know Something Is Wrong"

**Intro Paragraph:**
"You feel it every Monday morning. Every time your manager takes credit for your work. Every time you check your bank account and realize another month passed with nothing to show for it."

**Pain Point Cards:**

1. **Capped Income. Capped Future.**
   "You work harder than your boss, but your salary is locked. No matter how much you give, the ceiling stays low. Meanwhile, the owner gets richer from your effort."

2. **Underappreciated. Overworked.**
   "They call you 'essential,' but you're replaceable the moment you ask for more. Your ideas get ignored. Your contributions get forgotten. Your worth gets questioned."

3. **Insecure. One Paycheck Away.**
   "Retrenchments. Budget cuts. Restructuring. You know you could lose everything tomorrow, and there's nothing you can do about it. That's not stability—that's a gamble you didn't sign up for."

4. **Trapped in Toxic Politics.**
   "The favoritism. The backstabbing. The managers who protect their turf instead of developing talent. You didn't sign up to play games—you signed up to work. But the system doesn't reward competence. It rewards compliance."

**Transition Statement:**
"If this is your reality, you don't need motivation. You need a different foundation."

**Copy Notes:**
- Uses "you" language to make it personal
- Specific, visceral details that trigger recognition
- Not exaggerated—realistic experiences
- Ends with a pivot: not motivation, but strategy

---

### 3️⃣ WHAT YOU GET SECTION

**Section Headline:**
"What You Get in Milestone 1 (FREE)"

**Deliverables:**

1. **Your Personal Vision Board**
   "No fluffy dreams. No empty wishes. A clear, visual roadmap of what ownership looks like for you—your business, your legacy, your freedom. You'll see it. Then you'll build it."

2. **SWOT Analysis Using the TEEE Framework**
   "**Time. Energy. Experience. Expertise.** We audit what you actually have, not what you wish you had. Your strengths. Your gaps. Your real advantages. Your honest obstacles. No sugar-coating."

3. **Honest Self-Assessment**
   "You'll answer the hard questions: Where is your time going? What drains your energy? What experience do you have that others will pay for? What expertise makes you irreplaceable?"

4. **Foundation for the TABLE System**
   "Milestone 1 is the entry point to the full Z2B TABLE—a 10-milestone roadmap that takes you from employee to owner. This is where transformation begins."

**Reassurance Statement:**
"No selling. No spam. No gimmicks. Just clarity."

**Copy Notes:**
- Emphasizes what it's NOT (fluffy, motivational, fake)
- Introduces the TEEE Framework clearly
- Positions Milestone 1 as the start of a bigger journey
- Reinforces trust with "no selling, no spam"
