1. Open Coach ManLaw (coach-manlaw.html)
2. Click **"üìñ Today's Lesson"** on the sidebar
3. Complete the **BTSS Assessment** (Billionaire Table Stability Score)
4. Rate yourself honestly 0-100 on each leg:
   - üß† **Mindset Mystery**: How much do you think like a billionaire?
   - üí∏ **Money Moves**: How strong are your income systems?
   - ‚öôÔ∏è **Legacy Missions**: How automated is your business?
   - üåç **Momentum Movement**: How much influence do you have?

**Why this matters**: You can't improve what you don't measure. Your baseline shows where you start.

---

### STEP 2: Read Day 1 Lesson (3 minutes)
**"The Employee Trap: Why You're Stuck"**

1. Open the lesson modal (already opened from Step 1)
2. Read the content: Understanding the psychological chains of employment

## üí° PRO TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### 1. **Don't Skip Days**
Consistency is EVERYTHING. Miss 1 day = momentum lost. Do the minimum if you're busy, but never skip.

### 2. **Do the Activities**
Reading alone doesn't transform you. DOING transforms you. Complete every activity.

### 3. **Be Honest on BTSS**
Don't inflate your scores. Honest assessment = real growth. Track progress, not perfection.

### 4. **Use the Z2B Apps**
When a lesson recommends an app (ZYRO, GLOWIE, BENOWN, ZYRA, etc.), USE IT. Apps accelerate results.

### 5. **Talk to Coach Manlaw Daily**
Ask questions. Share struggles. Celebrate wins. Coach Manlaw AI is there 24/7 to guide you.

### 6. **Join the Community**
Share your journey on ZYRO. Connect with other Legacy Builders. Accountability = results.

### 7. **Implement Immediately**
Don't wait until "someday." Implement today's lesson TODAY. Speed wins.

### 8. **Track Everything**
Keep a journal. Screenshot your BTSS scores. Document wins. Your transformation story inspires others.

### 9. **Celebrate Milestones**
Hit Day 20? Celebrate! Day 50? Party! Day 75? Big celebration! Day 90? MASSIVE event!

### 10. **Pay It Forward**
As you transform, invite others. Help them start their journey. Your legacy multiplies through others.
