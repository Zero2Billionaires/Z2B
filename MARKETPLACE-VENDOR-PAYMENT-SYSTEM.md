# Z2B Marketplace - Vendor Payment System

## Overview
The Z2B Marketplace allows members to sell Digital Products, Physical Products, and Services. The system uses a dynamic pricing model that ensures vendors get paid their desired income while funding the MLM commission pool and platform operations.

---

## üìä Pricing Formula

### How Retail Price is Calculated

```
Final Retail Price = Member Income + MLM Pool + Platform Fee
```

Where:
- **Member Income** = The amount YOU want to earn per sale
- **MLM Commission Pool** = 100% of Member Income (goes to your upline)
- **Platform Fee** = 7.5% of (Member Income + MLM Pool)

### Example Calculation

If you want to earn **R100** per sale:

```
Member Income:        R 100.00
MLM Commission Pool:  R 100.00  (100% markup)
Platform Fee:         R  15.00  (7.5% of R200)
--------------------------------
Final Retail Price:   R 215.00
```

**What this means:**
- Customer pays: **R215**
- You receive: **R100**
- Your upline receives: **R100** (distributed via MLM plan)
- Platform receives: **R15** (covers hosting, payment processing, support)
